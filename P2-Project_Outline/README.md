## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am simply calling my project "Motivation".  It is to be a calendar based personal tracker.  It will allow a user to keep track of what ever they might need.
This idea came to me when I saw my wife struggling to get our four young children motivated to get ready for school in the morning, thus making her late for work.
That is when I figured I could make getting ready for school a bit of a game for them.  They can check of items as they get ready on the tracker to get reward points
earning them a special treat.  My wife could easily create a tracker containing all four kids, and make categories like:  wake up, get dressed, bush teeth, come hair,
and pack snacks.  The kids can then check the items off as they do them totalling points over the course of the week to earn treats.

The "Motivation" tracker can be used for any kind of tracking in someone's life.  For instance, tracking four kids in multiple categories of things to do or chores.
Help keep track of personal fitness goals or diets, and create grocery or shopping lists easily.  Anything you need help with to keep you motivated or on track.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I am still learning all of this.  I am still very green to programming.  I will have to learn how to use some JavaScript as I would like to incorporate it to make the
front end look nicer.  I imagine I will also need to learn how to access and use certain API's.
